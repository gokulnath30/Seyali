# Seyali is 4X Faster Image annotaion tool 

## Installation 
 * baasic python installation
 * pip install -r requirements

## Run Application
* py  mange.py migrate 
* py mange.py runserver 






Important of Data Annotation:
-----------------------------

* Data is the backbone of AI and ML algorithms.
* Data annotation facilitates a deeper understanding of the meanings of the objects,thereby allowing algorithms to perform better.
* Computers canâ€™t process visual information the way human brains do.
* If data labelling is not done, ML algorithms cannot compute the essential attributes with ease.

## Advantages of Seyali:
---------------------

* Easy creation of labeled datasets.
* Fast track model training.
* Important step in the machine learning dataset building process.
* Seyali has a user-friendly interface that allows users to upload and annotate images for training their computer vision models.
* Seyali integrates with other popular computer vision platforms such as TensorFlow and PyTorch, making it easy to import and export models.

## Future plan of Seyali annotation tool:
--------------------------
* Smart labeling tools will dominate the future AI and ML landscape.
* Data annotation capabilities will be fully automatic, detecting labels without any manual intervention.
* As machine learning algorithms become more advanced, we may see more automation in the annotation process.For example, tools that can automatically identify and label objects in an image, or that can suggest annotations based on user input.
* Annotation types such as bounding boxes, polygons, and semantic segmentation, we may see more advanced types of annotations in the future.For example, tools that can annotate 3D objects, or that can annotate multiple objects at once.
